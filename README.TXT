This library helps software development teams accomplish two goals:
1.) share common configuration data between multiple applications.
2.) switch configuration data used by applications via a global "environment name".

Several samples of ConfigPTFE usage are included in the solution. 

Some examples may require you to setup databases via the provided sql scripts.   

Some examples may require you to install configuration files at a common location on your filesystem via the Administration utility provided as a project in this solution.
